# Payment Form
![image_2023-06-10_14-59-34](https://github.com/dzhusoleksiy/Payment-Form/assets/121053807/a99d1313-a777-4026-9c16-434775fb943b)
This payment form was created using Webpack with the help of HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. 

I designed it myself in order to enhance my form-building skills. Therefore, this webpage has an intuitive design with all the necessary verifications. This card-rotating interface may initially appear challenging to use for some users, but I have made it user-friendly, even for those who prefer keyboard operation instead of using a mouse while filling out such forms.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that this is in some ways a legitimate continuation of my previous project â€” ["Electron" Electronics Store Webpage](https://github.com/dzhusoleksiy/Electon).
