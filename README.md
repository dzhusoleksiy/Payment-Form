# Payment Form
![image_2023-06-10_12-57-47](https://github.com/dzhusoleksiy/Payment-Form/assets/121053807/83382756-39df-45d7-84d7-3087dda8fd43)
This payment form was created using Webpack with the help of HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. 

I designed it myself in order to enhance my form-building skills. Therefore, this webpage has an intuitive design with all the necessary verifications. This card-rotating interface may initially appear challenging to use for some users, but I have made it user-friendly, even for those who prefer keyboard operation instead of using a mouse while filling out such forms.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that this is a legitimate continuation of my previous project â€” ["Electron" Electronics Store Webpage](https://github.com/dzhusoleksiy/Electon).
